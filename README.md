A game of racing snails!!

Not much of a game yet!!!

Things to do:

    1. Snails should follow lettuces. The closer it is the faster it goes.
       If hit a lettuce bite a bit and turn around!

    2. If the whole lettuce is eaten the snail stops :-(

    3. The game should end when one snail reaches the end.
